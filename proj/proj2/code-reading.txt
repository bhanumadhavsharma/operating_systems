1) 0xfffff000
2) LAMEbus
3) splhigh - sets spl to highest value, disabling all interrupts
   spl0 - sets spl to 0, enabling all interrupts
4) u_int32_t is unsigned 32 bits. int is signed 32 bits.
   u_int32_t will be able to store larger positive numbers.
5) It returns the old interrupt state.
6) Traditionally spl_high = 15
7) 100
8) d_open, d_close, d_io, d_ioctl
9) 32
10) 15
11) fs_sync, fs_getvolname, fs_getroot, fs_unmount
12) void thread_sleep (const void *addr);
13) 32 bits
14) (vop_ for all of these) open, close, reclaim, read, readlink, getdirentry, write, ioctl, stat, gettype, tryseek, fsync, mmap, truncate, namefile, creat, symlink, mkdir, link, remove, rmdir, rename, lookup, lookparent
15) 1024
16) 8
17) kern/include/kern/unistd.h
18) Yes. First, the scheduler bootstrap creates the run queue. Then, the thread bootstrap initializes the first thread.
19) Zombies are threads/processes that have exited but not been fully deleted yet.
20) runqueue = q_create(32); 
21) always device:, such as ser:
22) name with raw added to the end, such as lhd0raw
23) vn_countlock
24) Block devices and character devices
